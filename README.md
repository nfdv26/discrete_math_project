This program builds the adjacency matrix of the non-oriented graph by the given edges. Programm outputs a matrix of zeros and units of the size x * x where x is the highest vertex.

Â  In order to get the matrix you must enter the edges of the graph. one edge - one line, you need to enter the vertices of the edge through a comma. the number of edges is unlimited, as well as the number of vertices.
